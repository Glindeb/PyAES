This is an AES-128, AES-192, AES-256 bit encryption algorithm (Rijndael cipher)
implementation in Python 3.12 (also tested down to 3.9) (no external libraries needed).

OBS!
Please note that this is a purely educational project designed to be used as a learning
platform for myself and by that no security can be guaranteed for the data encrypted and decrypted
with the project. The project is not intended to be used for any type of security purposes.
